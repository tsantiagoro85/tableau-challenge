# tableau-challenge

The present challenge looked into the Citi Bike data. Due to the density of the datasets, only those from May to August 2023 were downloaded and merged using python (see this repo) prior data analysis in Tableau. The link below contains the Tableau analysis and results:

The following trends were of interest:

1. What types of bikes are available and which ones are more popular? Two types of bikes are available to use, and data indicated that classic bikes are, overall, more popular than electric bikes based on the total number of rides (left). When looking into the data from May to August of 2023, results indicate that classic bikes were popular throughout the selected months, but May showed a higher number of rides (right). Electric bikes, while less popular than classic bikes, seemed to have more users in August. This trend may be associated with weather conditions on the north east coast in USA, where temperatures in May are "nicer" and suitable to ride classic bikes, whereas August can be hotter and humid and thus, electric bikes may be more convenient.

2. Who uses bikes more and more often? There are two types of users of classic and electric bikes: casual users and members. Results showed that members take advantage of classic and electric bikes, as shown with the total number of rides (left). Results also showed that members use both classic and electric bikes more often in June and July, as shown with the total number of rides (right).

3. What are the most popular stations to start a bike ride? There are thousands of stations to start riding, but a couple of them seem to be more popular than others. When looking into the top 15 most popular start stations, the treemap below shows the total number of rides - red being most popular and blue less popular. Broadway & W 58 St is the most popular start station, regardless of bike and user type, as well as month, followed by West St & Chambers St and University PI & E 14 St.
