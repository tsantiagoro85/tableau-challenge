# tableau-challenge

The present challenge looked into the Citi Bike data. Due to the density of the datasets, only those from May to August 2023 were downloaded and merged using python (see this repo) prior data analysis in Tableau. The link below contains the Tableau analysis and results:

The following trends were of interest:

1. What types of bikes are available and which ones are more popular? Two types of bikes are available to use, and data indicated that classic bikes are, overall, more popular than electric bikes based on the total number of rides (left). When looking into the data from May to August of 2023, results indicate that classic bikes were popular throughout the selected months, but May showed a higher number of rides (right). Electric bikes, while less popular than classic bikes, seemed to have more users in August. This trend may be associated with weather conditions on the north east coast in USA, where temperatures in May are "nicer" and suitable to ride classic bikes, whereas August can be hotter and humid and thus, electric bikes may be more convenient.

2. Who uses bikes more and more often? There are two types of users of classic and electric bikes: casual users and members. Results showed that members take advantage of classic and electric bikes, as shown with the total number of rides (left). Results also showed that members use both classic and electric bikes more often in June and July, as shown with the total number of rides (right).

3. What are the most popular stations to start a bike ride? There are thousands of stations to start riding, but a couple of them seem to be more popular than others. When looking into the top 15 most popular start stations based on total number of rides, the treemap below shows the total number of rides - red being most popular and blue less popular. Broadway & W 58 St is the most popular start station, regardless of bike and user type, as well as month, followed by West St & Chambers St and University PI & E 14 St.

4. On the opposite spectrum, what are the most popular stations to end a bike ride? Similar to start stations, there are thousands of stations to finalize a bike ride. When looking into the top 15 most popular stations to end a bike ride based on total number of rides, the treemap below shows the total number of rides - red being most popular and blue less popular. Cleveland PI & Spring St is the most popular station to end a bike ride, regardless of bike and user type, as well as month, followed by 6 Ave & W 34 St and W 24 St and 7 Ave.

5. How can we visualize the most popular start stations on a map? And how does the number of rides across the start stations compare from May through August? The map on the left shows the most popular stations to start a bike ride, where the total number of rides is depicted with the size and color of the circles. Circles shown in red and with the biggest sizes depict the most popular stations based on the total number of rides. Zipcodes are also shown on the map (left). As shown with some of the previous plots, members take advantage of the bikes and perform a number of rides (right). Members seem to start their bike rides more often at 11th Ave and W 41 St during the months of June and July.

6. How can we visualize the most popular stations to end a bike ride on a map? And how does the number of rides across the end stations compare from May through August? The map on the left shows the most popular stations to end a bike ride, where the total number of rides is depicted with the size and color of the circles. Circles shown in red and with the biggest sizes depict the most popular stations based on the total number of rides. Zipcodes are also shown on the map (left). As shown with some of the previous plots, members take advantage of the bikes and perform a number of rides (right). Members seem to end their bike rides more often at W 30 St and 10th Ave during the months of June and July.
